# sahils-chat-app
A react chat app developed with socket.io and Node JS for realtime communication over websites.

This chat app can be used by heading over to -> https://sahils-chat-app.netlify.app/

You'll need to enter your name and a room Id, if there's no room with that name/id, a new room will be created else you'll be joined to the existing room. 

Once in a room, you can easily communicate with the room members on real-time basis, the project is fully secure, and all your chats are deleted as soon as you leave the room. 

No tracebacks either, once the room is emptied, all its data is destroyed and it cannot be recovered.
